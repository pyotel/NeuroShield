# NeuroShield

NeuroShield is a shield board featuring the NM500 neuromorphic chip with
576 neurons ready to learn and recognize stimuli extracted from any type
of sensors including IMU, audio, environmental sensors, bio-signal, video
and more.

- NeuroShield is compatible with Arduino, Raspberry PI, and any microcontrollers which can support SPI
    communication.
    - D5	SPI_SELn, Enable access to the neurons via SPI. If not set the low, the interface is USB
    - D13	SCK
    - D12	MISO
    - D11	MOSI
    - D7	SPI_CS_NMn, to access the neurons
    - D6	SPI_CS_SDn, to access SD card

- NeuroShield can also be used as a simple USB dongle to empower PC-based applications with access to a NeuroMem network through a serial USB communication.


## Arduino library & examples

- **NeuroMem API library** establishes communication to the NeuroShield through SPI and access to the neurons of the NM500 chip (https://www.general-vision.com/documentation/TM_NeuroMem_Library_Arduino.pdf). Save data files and project files in a format compatible with the General Vision's Knowledge Builder tools and SDKs.
- **Academic scripts** to understand how easily you can teach the neurons and query them for simple recognition status, or a best match, or a detailed classification of the K nearest neurons. https://www.general-vision.com/techbriefs/TB_TestNeurons_SimpleScript.pdf
- **Motion recognition examples** using the on-board IMU from Invensense (MPU6050) and the IMU from the Arduino101. https://www.general-vision.com/techbriefs/TB_NeuroMemArduino_IMUDemo.pdf
- **Video recognition examples** using an ArduCAM shield. https://www.general-vision.com/techbriefs/TB_NeuroMemArduino_VideoMonitoringDemo.pdf


## Python library & examples for Raspberry Pi

On the raspberry PI, do not forget to enable the SPI interface, under Interfacing options (run sudo raspi-config).

- **Video recognition examples** using RaspiCam


## GV_NeuroMem API for Windows
- **NeuroMem API library (C/C++)** establishes communication to the NeuroShield through USB-serial port and access to the neurons of the NM500 chip (https://www.general-vision.com/documentation/TM_NeuroMem_API.pdf). Save data files and project files in a format compatible with the General Vision's Knowledge Builder tools and SDKs.

If you have never connected a device on your PC using a Cypress USB serial chip, the NeuroShield will not be detected unless you run the CypressDriverInstaller.exe
Under the Windows Device Manager,the NeuroMem USB dongle should appear as a Universal Serial Bus Controller with the label "USB Composite device"


## NeuroMem Console for Windows
Windows-based utility to test the good health of the dongle but also to experience with the neurons using simple Register Transfer Level transactions.

Open the console using Start/General Vision/NeuroMem Console.
The default platform shown in the upper left corner of the panel is "Simu" and the network capacity reported in the listbox to the right is 1024 neurons.
Change the platform to NeuroShield and verify that the network capacity reported in the listbox to the right is 576 neurons, or more if you have stacked some NeuroBrick modules on th NeuroShield.
